Note: You will need to make a config.js file in the project directory.
It's structure is similar to [config.js gist url](https://gist.github.com/war-turtle/208fab08315bc627982c7b7d7b423a90).
just add your mongodb url in the config.js file.

* Run the following command in the project directory to install all the required packages
```bash
npm install
```

* Run the following command in the project directory to run the server in development mode
```bashu online thodi der mein

npm run dev
